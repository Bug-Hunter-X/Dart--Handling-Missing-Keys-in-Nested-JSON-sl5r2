# Dart: Handling Missing Keys in Nested JSON

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with nested JSON data and provides a solution.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access nested JSON keys without proper error handling.  This can lead to runtime errors if the keys are missing.

The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to correctly handle these situations, preventing unexpected crashes.
